(animal) Move Persistence Mixed-effects Models

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This is a development package that fits a random walk with time-varying move persistence (autocorrelation) to multiple individual animal tracks. Move persistence (gamma_t) is a latent variable that is estimated as a linear mixed-effects function of user-supplied covariates. The models are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation via the `TMB` ([Template Model Builder](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp)) package and using C++. Random effects are assumed to be Gaussian. The `mpmm` package leverages tools from the `lme4` and `glmTMB` packages, adopting their formula syntax for random effects components. 

## Installation 
Currently, for testing and evaluation purposes only.
